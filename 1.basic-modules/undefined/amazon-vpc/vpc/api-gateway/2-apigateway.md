1. Click on the Test icon to provide a sample request message.
2. Copy and Paste the following JSON Sample in the Request Body section

```
{
  "price": "400000",
  "size": "1600",
  "unit": "sqFt",
  "downPayment": "20"
} 
```

1. Click Test

Please note the Response Body with a status code of 200. The body of the response contains the price per unit and the total cost. The header of the response along with the message body is composed by the lambda function. The testing page also shows a complete request/response log.

Notice that the lambda service returned the total cost, but did not account for the down payment. In the next section, we will transform the message to pass the down payment amount to the lambda function.
